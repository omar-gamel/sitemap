# Generating a Sitemap with Node.JS
Site maps are a very important aspect of SEO optimization. Google and other search engines can use a sitemap to figure out where all your pages are and how they link together

## Concept
Most sites are split into two vague categories:

 1- Pages which have URLs created (i.e. articles, blog posts, etc). /n
 2- Pages which have URLs which rarely change (i.e. home pages, etc).

To automate a sitemap, we can list out URLs we know are unlikely to change, and then use Javascript to take database entries of new pages and add these to our sitemap. Google and others will crawl this sitemap frequently, meaning new URLs are automatically added to Google.
